# UI Design Using Axure
This repository includes the UI design developed using Axure RP. Axure is used to create high-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes that showcase the user experience and functionality of the project.

## UI Design Overview
* Wireframes: The initial wireframes for the project are created to define the layout, user flow, and key screens.
* Interactive Prototypes: Axure allows us to build fully interactive prototypes that simulate the real-world behavior of the application. These prototypes help test usability, gather feedback, and refine the user experience.
* High-Fidelity Design: The UI design includes detailed visual components like buttons, navigation bars, forms, and other elements that represent the final look and feel of the application.

## Key UI Screens
* Homepage: Overview of the landing page, including navigation, key elements, and interactions.
* Dashboard: Design of the user dashboard with interactive widgets.

1. Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
